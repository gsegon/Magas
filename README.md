Magas
=====

Magas is an open source magnetostatic finite element solver. 


Installation from sources:
--------------------------
If building from sources, make sure all the dependencies are installed. See the dependecy list for more details.


Let's say you've unpacked the .tar.gz file into a directory /path/to/magas/sources. 
Then configure, compile, and install Magas with:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/where/magas/should/be/installed/to /path/to/magas/sources
    sudo make install    (alternatively $ make -j<N> install)
    make test

To build from the repository, execute the following commands first:

    git clone https://github.com/gsegon/Magas.git
    cd Magas

Then continue as before.


Installation from package managers:
-----------------------------------

Ubuntu/Debian

Add magas and dependecy repositories:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ginggs/deal.ii-9.4.0-backports
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gsegon/magas
    sudo apt update

Install magas:

    sudo apt-get install magas

    

Run an example:
--------------

Before running an example:

    $ sudo chown -R $USER ~/magas
    

Run an example:

    $ cd ~/magas/examples/motoric
    $ magas motoric.json

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Dependency list:
----------------

The only dependecy that needs to be installed spearately from magas is [deal.ii](https://www.dealii.org/). Instruction on how to install deal.ii can be found on the it's website. 
Other dependencies are included with Magas source code and can be found in _external_ directory.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests
